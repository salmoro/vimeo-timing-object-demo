A demo app using Timing Object together with Vimeo player.

Here we demonstrate how to synchronize video playback across the internet with just a few lines of code.

Of course, the Timing Object can be used in many ways (with or without video) and here we're just demonstrating its use with the Vimeo player.

# Background
There's a proposed W3C specification for the Timing Object which would introduce a new set of APIs that would simplify time-synchronization tasks for browser applications.

Proposed spec: https://webtiming.github.io/timingobject
